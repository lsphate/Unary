###ELEN E6770 Next Gen. Network - Final Project Proposal

#####Sun-Yi Lin (sl3833), Chia-Hao Hsu (ch3141)
We've got several ideas for what we're going to do in the final project. Here're the two we thought might fit the requirement most. We'll discuss later to figure out which one to be implemented, but right now we think both ideas are cool and really want to describe them here.

####Proposal - Group Events Scheduler
Sometimes it's just annoying to host a group event: everybody has his own time table and it's just a nightmare to find out a slot to fit everyone in.

Doodle is a website that radically simplifies the process of scheduling events, meetings, appointments, etc. It lets people mutually agree on a time. It's very convenient but we're thinking to make such tool even better. There are some feature of this app in our plan:

- Do not need to login to hold or reply an event.
- In addition to just pick your available time, you can even mark your prefer slots.

More features will be implied if we decide to run this proposal.####Environment & Tools
**Environment:**
We plan to implement our proposal in JavaScript, HTML / CSS, Python / flask. And store the relative data in Amazon Web Service.**Tools:**Python, Django, Javascript, HTML, Amazon Web Services, etc.*Required environment and tools could be changed base on actual necessary.*

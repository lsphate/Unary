####Unary - the group events scheduler
Sometimes it's just annoying to host a group event: everybody has his own time table and it's just a nightmare to find out a slot to fit everyone in.

Doodle is a website that radically simplifies the process of scheduling events, meetings, appointments, etc. It lets people mutually agree on a time. It's very convenient but we're thinking to make such tool even better. There are some feature of this app in our plan:

- Do not need to login to host or join an event.
- An intuitive view to know others availablities.

####Environment & Tools
**Environment:**
We plan to implement our proposal in JavaScript, HTML / CSS, Python, and Google App Engine.

**Tools:**
Python, Javascript(jQuery, Bootstrap, D3.js, moment.js), HTML, Google App Engine, etc.

*Required environment and tools could be changed base on actual necessary.*
